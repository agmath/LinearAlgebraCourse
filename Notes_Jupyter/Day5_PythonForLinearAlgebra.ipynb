You'll need to import modules in order to complete many specialized tasks. For the most part, we'll be making use of the `{sympy}` (SYmbolic Mathematics in PYthon) module since it has functionality for nearly everything we encounter in an introduction to Linear Algebra. It is also worth knowing, however, the existence of the `{numpy}` (NUMerical PYthon) module which handles numerical operations on vectors and matrices very well. Throughout the text we'll use these curly-braces `{}` to indicate that we are referencing a full module rather than just a Python function/method. When importing modules, we can either load the entire module (ie. `import sympy`) or we can just load a single function from that module (ie. `from numpy.linalg import inv`).\n","\n","With `{sympy}` imported, we can call and utilize functionality from that module. For example, `{sympy}` includes a `Matrix()` function which can be called using `sympy.Matrix()`, which tells Python to go to the `{sympy}` module and find the `Matrix()` function. Because we need to reference the module name when calling functionality from it, Python users often alias their module names when importing in order to reduce typing.
