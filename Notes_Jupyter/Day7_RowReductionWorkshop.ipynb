As mentioned previously, you'll have a row reduction Gateway Exam in MAT350 worth 15% of your overall course grade, that you'll need to pass before the end of the semester. You'll be able to retake the Gateway Exam multiple times in order to show mastery. Each Gateway Exam will consist of four matrices for you to reduce within a 20-minute time limit. You'll need to reduce all matrices to their reduced row echelon forms correctly in order to pass.\n","\n","Your first attempt at the Gateway Exam will take place at the end of this class meeting. Prior to that, we'll take time to practice."],"metadata":{"id":"kZ_0xfTQG1d0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Completed Examples\n","\n","We'll begin with serveral completed examples of varying dimensions and difficulty.
